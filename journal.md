### Objective: **Install QGIS, explore the interface, and learn how to navigate the map canvas and layers.  **

### What I Did:  
- Installed QGIS LTS (Long-Term Release) version 3.34.  
- Opened a new project and explored the default layout.  
- Loaded the OpenStreetMap basemap using the QuickMapServices plugin.  
- Practiced zooming, panning, and switching between layers.  
- Tested different shortcuts to move around the map efficiently.  

### What I Learned  
- Using the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out feels much easier than using the toolbar buttons.  
- The **Ctrl + Shift + F** shortcut quickly maximizes the map window, which helps when focusing on map layers.  
- The layout of QGIS reminds me of Photoshop or Google Earth — each layer stacks visually to build the full map.  
- The Layers panel controls visibility, order, and style, while the Browser panel helps access data sources.  

### Challenges / Confusions  
- At first, it was confusing figuring out where plugins are located and how to install them.  
- There are a lot of icons on the toolbar — I’m still learning what each one does.  
- I wasn’t sure which Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to use for default projects (I used WGS84 for now).  

### Connections / Reflections  
- This feels a lot like data visualization, but spatial — seeing patterns directly on a map is exciting.  
- The interface reminds me of how I used layering and coordinates in biology imaging and classroom data tracking.  
- I like how QGIS feels technical yet creative — a mix of coding logic and design.  

### Next Steps  
For Day 2, I want to:  
- Practice changing layer colors and symbology to make my maps clearer.  
- Learn how to label features (like park names or city districts) for my first project of mapping out the different parks in Boise.  
- Start experimenting with importing local shapefiles.
