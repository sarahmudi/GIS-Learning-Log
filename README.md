# GIS Analyst Learning Log

### About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m Sarah Bandlamudi, a biology and computer science graduate currently teaching at a tech high school.  
Iâ€™m transitioning into a GIS Analyst career because I love combining maps, data, and storytelling.

### Starting Goals (October 4, 2025)
1. Build a solid foundation in **Python**, **SQL**, and **GIS software** (*QGIS + ArcGIS Online*).  
2. Complete 4 major projects showing environmental, demographic, and spatial analysis.  
3. Learn to **automate geospatial workflows** using Python (geopandas, folium, shapely).  
4. Design a portfolio website to showcase my projects and insights.  
5. Use this repository to track progress â€” including code, screenshots, reflections, and project summaries.

> Every map tells a story â€” my goal is to learn how to make them meaningful.

### ðŸ§© Structure
- `/projects` â†’ final project folders (maps, code, data)
- `/notes` â†’ weekly reflections & progress logs
- `/images` â†’ exported map visuals
- `/data` â†’ cleaned sample datasets
